If you are getting back error responses which contain a [stripe error code](https://stripe.com/docs/error-codes), you should direct your question [directly to stripe](https://support.stripe.com/). Your [stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) will also have [detailed logs of every request made](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs).

If you are having issues with the paysly npm module itself, please contact us at: [support@paysly.io](mailto:support@paysly.io).
