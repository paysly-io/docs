# Overview

Paysly offers tooling to facilitate the acceptance of payments on your website. You can create payments by installing the paysly npm package and then calling one of its methods with the details of the payment you would like to collect. For details on how to accept payments, check out our guides to [one time](guides/one-time-charges.html) or [recurring](guides/recurring-charges.html) charges.

Paysly is powered by stripe - so, in conjunction with paysly's frontend tooling, you have full access to the [stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), as well as the stripe [APIs and SDKs](https://stripe.com/docs).

### [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)

While paysly's goal is to make your integration as simple as possible, if you have any questions on the status of payments, disputes, subscriptions, or any other payments related issues, the stripe dashboard is the source of truth. 

### [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs)

If you have integration related questions, including error codes, payment confirmations, or any other technical queries, the stripe api docs should be able to answer them.
